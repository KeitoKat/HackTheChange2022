# Inspiration
We initially drew inspiration from the UN global issues [https://www.un.org/en/global-issues]. Given the recent political issues in the East, we have also withnessed many call-to-action that aims to help refugees escape the Russo-Ukrainian War.

# What it does
Our website is an Airbnb-like platform for refugees who are looking for the closest, safest or most-welcoming home to shelter themselves. We match each user to host families based on basic features like: country and language used.

# How we built it
We made the website using:

- ReactJS for front-end;
- NodeJS and Express for back-end;
- MUI, Boostrap, and CSS for styling.

# Challenges we ran into
Some of the things we spent a while working on are:

- ```react-router-dom``` wasn't routing properly.
- We resolved it by rearranging some essential packages.
  After reading serveral stackoverflow posts, we found out that the package should be installed inside react app. If it is installed in the wrong package, it would be causing "Invalid Hook Call" error.
 
 # Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our group is made up of people with varying skill levels. We could not be more proud of how well we have worked together despite that.

# What we learned
- How ReactJS and NodeJs frameworks are connected and ran in parallel with each other
- Debugging: commenting lines of code, reading error messages, and seek help from Stack Overflow and from peers)
- Time management: splitting parts and checking in with in each on the progress once in a while to ensure that everyone is on task, but is not burnt out at the same time.

# What's next for Refuge Me
- Refining the front and back-end to improve User's experience and the interface

- Build a secure database to store information collected from guests and hosts
